			<h2>First 2D Project</h2>

			<video width=100% controls loop preload="auto">
				<source src="Games/Project2D/Project 2D.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			<p>First 2D project made in Unity. A space invaders like game where there are random enemies spawning as
				well as asteroids, and the goal is to survive and score as high as possible. The character is on the
				bottom and can only move left and right, but it can shoot to gain score, and he has 3 lives before it is
				game over.</p>

				<p>I scripted all the player and enemy movements. The player can use a and d to move as well as space for shooting projectiles and B for shooting bombs. I scripted randomized patterns and fire rate as well for both the player and the enemies. </p>

			<h2>Animation Soundscape</h2>

			<video width=100% controls loop preload="auto">
				<source src="AudioProjects/Samuel Villalobos Animation Soundscape.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			<p>
				I used the <a href="https://youtu.be/wLCJe67Uodk" target="_blank">Six-Tails Naruto vs Pain | Naruto
					Shippuden</a> fight and scraped all the audio of the video, and I made the whole soundscape for the
				characters and environment. </p>

				<p>I used a good amount of repeated sounds due to Audition being a little slow towards the ending of this piece, but I still used an ambundance of sounds to capture the essence of the environment and characters alike. </p>

			<p>A game with a theme about dogs featuring my dog as the background for the game, as well as music made by
				me, and it is about a dog who has an insatiable hunger for dog treats, and everytime he gets full, the
				dog gets more hungry the next time. It was made in p5.js using javascript as the main coding language. </p>
