			<h3>Created Spring 2024 by Samuel Villalobos</h3>

			<p><span class="audioBold">Requirements for Project:</span> Produce an audio story approximately 90 seconds
				in length. Write the dialog for the

				multi-track environment.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="audioBold">Description:</span> A story about brainstorming for an audio story project where
				I layer sound effects to what I am saying during the story. At the end, I break the fourth wall, and a
				misterious person tells me to go back to telling the story which I comically notice late that there was
				another person there.

			<p>
				<span class="audioBold">Side note:</span> I played the piano for this Audio Story.
